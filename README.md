# Fibonacci
A simple resolution to a common algorithm excercise.

## The problem
**Print to the console the _"FIBONACCI SEQUENCE"_, a sequence of numbers beginning with _0_ and _1_, beeing the next one the sum of the two predecessors. The number passed as parameter is the amount of iteractions the list should have.**

*Example: for a list that should have 8 iteractions,*  
0  
1  
1  
2  
3  
5  
8  
13  
21  
34  
55  

## The solution
We use two examples of solution:
- one by making a *for* loop and making the sum of the two predecessor numbers;
- other by making a recursive loop, making the sum by calling the same function passing the two predecessor numbers.
